## Running the Project Locally

These instructions will help you set up a copy of the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installing & Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnanand2517/krish-portfolio
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory & install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd krish-portfolio
   npm install
   ```

1. Once you have installed the project and its dependencies, you can run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend server on port 4321, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:4321`.
